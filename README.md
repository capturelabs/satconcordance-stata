Example recode statements in Stata to concord new and old SAT values

## Overview
Each .do file in this repository provides the Stata syntax to recode an SAT® or ACT® variable into a new or old format. The name of each .do file reflects the transformation contained in the file. Simply copy/paste the recode command into your .do file and change the variable names in the recode statement to correspond to your variable names. Each .do file contains a reproducible example that demonstrates the behavior of the recode command. The examples generate 10 sample observations, then generate 10 feasible starting values in a new variable, and finally generate an ending variable that contains the recoded scores. View the resulting variables with the browse command.
